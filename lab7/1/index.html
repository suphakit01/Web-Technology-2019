            <h1>Programming language</h1>
            <p>A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various
                kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>

                <h3>C Language</h3>
                <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and
                    1973. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The
                    main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean
                    style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or
                    compiler development.</p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially designed
                    by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for
                    emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines
                    of code.</p>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. A platform is an
                    environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.
                    Java is fast, reliable and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to
                    gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner.</p>
